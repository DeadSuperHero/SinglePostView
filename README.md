Single Post View
==============

This is taken directly from Diaspora's existing source code. The feature itself is being taken out, but it's a nifty way to present content, so I figured I'd scoop it up and put it in a GitHub repo before it gets lost to the ages.

The Single Post View is an immersive way to display content, and was used to display full-page user posts. The viewer is written mostly in Backbone.js, and this repo has a couple of related models thrown in to demonstrate the existing implementation. Please take note, this probably will take some refactoring to make it useful beyond just being a Diaspora post viewer.
